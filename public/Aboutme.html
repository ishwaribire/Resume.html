        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am Preeti Satao, a Computer Engineering student at PCCOER, Pune. I’m currently in my second year and interested in web development, data and AI, and core CS subjects like operating systems. I have experience with C, Python, Java, and HTML, and I actively participate in GDG On Campus as a marketing team member. Along with technology, I enjoy content creation, designing, and dance, which keep me creative and socially engaged.

            Creativity is something I naturally gravitate toward. I enjoy content creation, video editing, and designing, as they allow me to express ideas in a visual and engaging way. Dance is another important part of my life—it helps me stay energetic, expressive, and connected with people. Being socially active has taught me how to collaborate, listen, and adapt, which I believe are essential skills in both life and work.
